# Go ddd example

This project is my attempt at using ***DDD, CQRS, clean architecture*** and 
***event sourcing*** patterns to create a simple task management project.

Some architecture decisions in this project are redundant, but the main goal 
was to apply this patterns ***in practice***.

## Progress

I'm currently focused on a working project, so I decided to use a familiar 
database and implement event sourcing after all services will be completed. 
And also this approach will help me understand how easy it would be to maintain
and extend this project.
